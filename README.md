Read this only if you facing path loading problem. 



The game is using stable path to load bmps, if you want to double click the .exe file to run , you will needs to create a Assignment File and Assets file inside it, in the bin folder, then copy .bmps from Assets inside The new created Assets file.
Otherwise if you using the running command ./Assignment/bin/game.exe in coding environment , it will work automatically.

And I've Created the file for you ,but if you want to recompile the game.exe file , and if theres a path collision , delete the Assignment file inside the Assignment file.
